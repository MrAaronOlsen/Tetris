# Tetris
###### A Ruby Tetris Clone
Written in all Ruby using Gosu. Uses only native rendering. No sprites or images. I try my best to follow the official [Tetris Development Rules](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline). 

#### Install
First off you'll need Ruby 2.6.5

Simply clone the repo and run:`$ Bundle Install`<br>
Launch Tetris with `$ Ruby Tetris`
